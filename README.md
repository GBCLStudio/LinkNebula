This is an experiment project that is for an interesting thought:

```
What if, we could send message between the two,
unless the physical distance, but without Internet Connection?
```

Comparing to satellite, I choose NearLink, a product released by Huawei.
Because it's cheap and easy to get started with.

However, I'm new to Embedded development, and not so familiar with Rust.
So, there might be a plethora of bugs and mistakes.

Just consider this as a toy by a Senior High.

Ended, have a good day :)
